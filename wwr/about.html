            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in Lagos, Nigeria, Lagoon Luxe Rafting began with a passion for blending thrilling adventure
                with
                premium
                comfort. What started as a simple idea—bringing world-class rafting experiences to Nigeria’s coastal
                and
                river
                landscapes—quickly grew into a full-fledged adventure brand known for safety, elegance, and
                unforgettable moments.

                Inspired by Lagos’ vibrant waterways and the untamed beauty of Nigeria’s natural environment, the
                company was built to
                provide an escape from the ordinary. Over the years, Lagoon Luxe Rafting has evolved into a pioneer
                of
                luxury rafting
                tourism, offering exclusive guided expeditions, curated nature journeys, and refined outdoor
                experiences
                that allow
                guests to connect with nature without sacrificing comfort.</p>
