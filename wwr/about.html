            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history">
                <p>Founded in Lagos, Nigeria, Lagoon Luxe Rafting began with a passion for blending thrilling adventure
                    with
                    premium
                    comfort. What started as a simple idea bringing world-class rafting experiences to Nigeria’s coastal
                    and
                    river
                    landscapes quickly grew into a full-fledged adventure brand known for its commitment to safety,
                    elegance, and
                    unforgettable moments. From the very beginning, the mission was clear: to create an elevated outdoor
                    experience that
                    brings people closer to the water in a way that feels both exciting and luxurious. This vision
                    attracted
                    explorers,

                    adventure
                    outings.</p>

                    environment,

                    built to provide an escape from the ordinary where tranquility meets adrenaline on every expedition.
