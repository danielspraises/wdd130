        <p>Lagos is a vibrant and dynamic state located in the southwestern region of Nigeria. Despite being the
            smallest state in
            terms of land area, it is the most populous, with an estimated population exceeding 20 million residents.
            Lagos lies
            along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, giving it a strategic position for trade, tourism, and economic
            activities. It
            shares borders with Ogun State to the north and east, the Republic of Benin to the west, and the Atlantic
            Ocean to the
            south. The state is known for its bustling urban centers, including Lagos Island and Victoria Island, as
            well as its
            rich cultural heritage, diverse population, and status as Nigeria’s commercial and financial hub</p>
